# Editable Task Table (React via CDN)

This is a simple task tracking table I built using React without using create-react-app or any build tools. It’s part of a frontend assessment I received.

The idea was to display a table where each row represents a task, and the cells are editable. Once edited, the data is stored in state and logged in the console on clicking the Save button — simulating an API-ready format.
